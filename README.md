I use this matrix  because is ideal for creating a tabular visualization with rows and columns, where each cell represents a salary metric.
-----------------------------------------

To achieve this, I followed these steps:

Simplified the visuals by choosing clear and familiar chart types such as bar and line charts.
I dident use slicers for easy filtering, because no need the grafic shows clearly the salary for state and company.
Used tooltips and labels to provide additional context for the visual elements.
Organized the report in a logical layout, starting with a summary overview and then detailed sections."
